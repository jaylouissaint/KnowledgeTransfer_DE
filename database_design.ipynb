    "## Part 1: Designing the database\n",
    "\n",
    "In Part 1 of the project, your team must design a table schema for the data. By “table schema” I mean the CREATE TABLE statements necessary to create database tables that fit the data. You should follow the design principles in Section 4.1 to build a normalized structure for the database that minimizes redundant information. Include primary keys, foreign keys, column types, and any appropriate constraints. It is up to you to decide how many tables you need, their names, and their contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your CREATE TABLE statements in a notebook. Test them out on Azure to ensure they work correctly. You do not need to load any real data into the database yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the notebook, write comments explaining the following: What are the basic entities in your schema? (In Example 4.1, entities were things like songs, record labels, and albums, that each had their own database table.) How did you choose them and what did you do to ensure there is not redundant information in your database?\n",
    "\n",
    "From the IPEDS data, obtain:\n",
    "\n",
    "* All information about the institution’s name, location, address, and similar\n",
    "* All Carnegie Classification 2021 variables\n",
    "* The Census identifiers that apply to it: Core Based Statistical Area (CBSA) and its type, the Combined Statistical Area (CSA), and the county FIPS code -- where is this info? \n",
    "* Latitude and longitude of the institution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of these values will not change from year to year, but they can, since colleges can change names, move, grow, or change.\n",
    "\n",
    "The College Scorecard data also includes crosswalk files giving links between OPEIDs (in the College Scorecard data) and UNITIDs (in the IPEDS) data, so you can match between datasets."

    "## Database Schema Design Reasoning\n",
    "For this project, the database schema is designed to track institutions and their yearly data while minimizing redundancy and ensuring data integrity. The core principle is to separate attributes that remain stable over time from those that change annually.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Entities:\n",
    "* Institutions – Stores static information about each university, including name, address, geographic coordinates, accrediting agency, ownership type, and classification codes (e.g., Carnegie classification). Each institution is uniquely identified by a UNITID primary key. These attributes are unlikely to change frequently, so they are stored once per institution.\n",
    "* Financials, Academics, and Demographics – Store time-dependent information, such as tuition, program offerings, enrollment, and student demographics. Each row corresponds to one institution in a given year. A YEAR column tracks the year of the data, and the UNITID foreign key links each record back to the Institutions table.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reference Tables:\n",
    "We created eight reference tables for categorical columns: PREDDEG, HIGHDEG, CONTROL, REGION, CCBASIC, CCUGPROF, CCSIZSET, and ST_FIPS. These tables map integer IDs to descriptive text values. By storing categories in reference tables and joining them by ID:\n",
    "We follow the DRY principle, eliminating duplication of repeated text data. We reduce memory usage and computing power, since integers are much more efficient than storing long text strings repeatedly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Design Principles:\n",
    "* Normalization (DRY): Separating static, time-dependent, and categorical data avoids redundancy and ensures updates are centralized.\n",
    "* Referential Integrity: Foreign keys link yearly data and categorical reference tables to institutions, preventing orphaned records.\n",
    "* Versioning: Including a YEAR column in time-dependent tables allows tracking historical changes and maintaining a clear record of each dataset version.\n",
    "* Efficient Storage: Joining with reference tables for categorical data improves performance and reduces storage costs.\n",
    "* Ease of Analysis & Visualization: Separating data into logical categories (Financials, Academics, Demographics) allows for more flexible filtering and targeted visualizations. For example, we can analyze only demographic factors without loading academic or financial data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "This schema allows efficient storage and querying of both stable and changing attributes of institutions while maintaining consistency, minimizing duplication, and supporting historical, categorical, and visualization-focused analysis.\n"
