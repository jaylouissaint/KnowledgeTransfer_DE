    "\n",
    "In Part 1 of the project, your team must design a table schema for the data. By “table schema” I mean the CREATE TABLE statements necessary to create database tables that fit the data. You should follow the design principles in Section 4.1 to build a normalized structure for the database that minimizes redundant information. Include primary keys, foreign keys, column types, and any appropriate constraints. It is up to you to decide how many tables you need, their names, and their contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your CREATE TABLE statements in a notebook. Test them out on Azure to ensure they work correctly. You do not need to load any real data into the database yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the notebook, write comments explaining the following: What are the basic entities in your schema? (In Example 4.1, entities were things like songs, record labels, and albums, that each had their own database table.) How did you choose them and what did you do to ensure there is not redundant information in your database?"
